# Startup Rules
Recently I realized that in order to succeed with your own startup, you need to *know the rules*. Which options you have at your disposal and which are the most suitable for you at a given moment. Should you fundraise your money? Or run a Kickstarter campaign instead? And what about hiring practices? There are many questions for which I don't have conclusive answers, yet. However I will compile all relevant sources into this repository.

Contribution is very welcome. Please issue a pull request and I will look into it. Thanks!
