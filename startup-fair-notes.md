# Starport Startup Fair - key notes
This one-day conference was focused on building successful startups in Košice area. This area is specific by its relatively small size compared to Budapest, Paris and other centres. It is harder to get funds and it takes significantly longer time. Košice can't offer thousands of available developers. In order to succeed, you need to come with an idea, which can be implemented cheaply - just by a couple of people. As an advantage, development costs to build an MVP are lower.

## Competitors
One of the successful strategies is to observe your competition, which server in another region. You can "copycat" their business model. Because they're not in our region, you can get traction and still be successful.
- Look at their financial data and other publicly accessible documents
- Business model is already proven to be working
- Example: GymBeam
- If possible, focus on hardware/physical product or a combination of hardware and software. It is harder to reproduce for your competition

## Hypothesis validation
- Try to be as effective as possible. Do not build realistic product to prove your hypothesis, unless it is absolutely necessary.
- Many ideas can be validated within hours. Get pen and paper and ask people around! As an example, one of the contestants on StartupWeekend validated his hypothesis during weekend - he used Facebook. Another example, people building an app for senior care could visit Retirement Home across the street to get valuable data they need.
- MVP may not always be the best approach. There are other ways, look around what suits your conditions best. Check out Risklest Assumption Test (https://gbksoft.com/blog/minimum-viable-product-and-alternatives-you-may-consider/)

## Business Model
- Sometimes your model may work, but timing may be off
- One of the speakers had a startup providing SaaS to construction builders. Their company took traction few years later, when the market was ready.
- It may be impressive to investors, if you include your financial projections into your presentation. However most of the potential investors expect to build that in cooperation with you.
- Building a startup from bottom has advantages in flexibility. Intrapreneurs need to persuade existing company leaders.
- Intra-company R&D became less effective comparing to startups. As an example, employees of one company near bankrupt worked during their business hours on a product, which they could offer to their customers. They had direct customer feedback and their product was ready to market. Development costs - 0. They made it during their normal working hours, for which they got paid. On the other hand, there was another company, which invested large sums of money in order to do extensive research and they had no product. As a result, bigger company bought the smaller one and offered their product.

## Legal
### Copyright
Copyright holder is always "human". A developer, designer etc. You get copyrights just by writing code.

#### Copyright Transfer
When you as a developer work for a company, this company needs to have a legal paper with you, giving them rights to your work. If they have such a document with your limited liability company (s.r.o.), not you, they don't own the data.

- Many startups forget on copyright transfer. If they hire a temp contractor, they *need* to have a copyright transfer paper signed by him.

### Trademark
Trademark is not for free. However you can get EU-wide trademark for around 1800 EUR. Dispute period is around 6 months, where other companies could dispute your claim. Always consult with lawyer.

### Patent
Always consult with lawyer.

## Presentation
- Be prepared
- Be concise
- Do not exceed your assigned time slot
- Your presentation should not be too long
- Know your audience. If you work on highly technical product, simplify your presentation. Give examples, so that investors could imagine what's your product good for.
- Back your claims with data. Before you go to investors, gather as much data as possible. Validate your hypothesis. Look at your competition and explain, why you are better etc.
- Always include your team members. Investors often invest in your team. You'll often pivot and change your market, strategy or product. You need to persuade them on the quality of your team.

## Funding
- 2-3 founders are ideal for investors
- It means you persuaded at least one person, that your product has potential
- If you are solopreneur, you need to build quality team around you. Then you still have a chance to get funds.
- Best startups don't go to startup competitions. They work on their product instead and do networking.
- Venture Funds compete with others all around the world. Even if you are from a small city, they *will* check up on you, if your company has potential. See Excalibur from a village near Poprad.
- Startup goes through a series of funding. You get pre-seed money, seed money, series A, B, C... When a funding round is over, you need to start preparing for next one. Getting funds in Slovakia takes longer (10-12 months compared to 4-6 months elsewhere)
- Startup ecosystem is not build sufficiently in Slovakia
- Founder of Startup Awards: "I created a monster". In Bratislava, you have startup events and competitions almost every day, but companies don't focus that much on their work and on their product. They want to be seen instead.

## 3 components of a successful startup
- [x] idea
- [x] people (team)
- [x] funding

If you have an idea, you need to persuade few people and get your founders. Then work on your business plan and try to get pre-seed funding. All 3 components are equally important and you go in this spiral throughout the life of your startup.
