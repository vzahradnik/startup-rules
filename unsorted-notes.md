# Unsorted Notes
Here I will put my notes, which I will later process into more structured way.

## My observations
- [LinkedIn][LinkedIn] is far more important as I thought. At least in Europe. Some of the entrepreneurs I met aren't visible on Twitter or Facebook, but are very active on LinkedIn. Apparently this social network should not be ignored. I should at least have up-to-date profile and check occasionally for incoming messages. Lesson learned!
- Look more into *Design Thinking* approach. It allows us to better define requirements and tell if the product is what the users *really* want. In a longterm it should save us a lot of time and money.
